    "bio": "As a burgeoning Software Engineer and Machinist, I bring with me the credo of check twice cut once, as I transition between fields. Coming from a world of precision manufacturing I understand that we are only as good as our last part, and that our product needs to work the way our customer intends for it whenever the need arises. While manufacturing enters the digital age it is time to bring our processes into tomorrow. I am committed to delivering manufactured quality with a digital edge."
