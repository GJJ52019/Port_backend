    "bio": "As a burgeoning Software Engineer and Machinist, I bring with me the credo of check twice cut once, as I transition between fields. Coming from a world of precision manufacturing I understand that we are only as good as our last part, and that our product needs to work the way our customer intends for it whenever the need arises. While manufacturing is entering the digital age I thought to follow suit. I am committed to brining a Manufacturing touch to a Software Developers world."
